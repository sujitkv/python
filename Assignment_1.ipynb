    "Q.1 In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "these are the values: 'hello', -87.8, 6\n",
    "and these are the expression/mathematical operator: *,-/+\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2 What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. String:A string is a datatype.it consists of alphabets, characters, special symbol and can be          represent with sigle and doube quotation. A String can be immutable.\n",
    "     --------\n",
    "     Variable:whereas the variable is a symbolic name or identifier that represents a value stored in      memory.the value of variable can be change during the execution of the program.it is generally        holding the memory address of the value.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Q.3 Decribe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Integer: that holds any numeric value from (whole number) 0 to n number.it can be negative positive both. and can be assign using the assignment operator(=).\n",
    "\n",
    "Float: in this data type all the float values included like 12.45.it can be negative ad positive both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean: Values inside this data type either True or False. if the scenerio/condition is correct then it will return True else it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.4 What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An expression is made up of some values and some mathematical operations that giving it a meaning.a variable to hold the values/outcome. and paranthesesis or bracket for a errorfree expression. for example result= a(b+c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5 This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A expression consist of some values, mathematical operators like assigment operator. A value to hold the value and paranthesis/bracket for a error free transition. on the other hand, statement that gives you only some information to a actio or sequence of actions.it only tells machine to do something like in the above assignment statement, it can be vary like declaration statement or if, else etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6 After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. when we initialize our bacon varable with 22 upto that time the value is 22 and after +1 it become 23. so 23 is the final value that stored in bacon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7 What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. values for both the terms will be same 'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.8 Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. in python programming language:  A variable should be start with alphabet letters or an underscore. if it starts with an underscore then after that it will contain letters or digits(0-9).\n",
    "follow the lower case naming convention for the better readability only. So in the above case eggs variable following all the checkpoints whereas 100 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.9 What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. int(): for the integer values\n",
    "float(): for the float values\n",
    "str(): for the string values\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.10 Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 'I have eaten' + ' 99 ' + 'burritos.' because a concatenation can be occur in same data type so i changed 99 into string."
